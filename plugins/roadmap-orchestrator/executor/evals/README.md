# Evals

A change is not done until the ladder passes, in order, from `executor/`:

1. `npm run typecheck`: `tsc --noEmit` over `src/`, `test/` and `evals/`.
2. `npm test`: `node --test test/*.test.ts`, pure-module and integrated tests, fake backends only. This tier
   includes `test/evals-m1.test.ts`, which runs the M1 fixture below end to end against the fakes, and
   `test/upgrade.test.ts`, which starts it on the previous release's executor (`PREVIOUS_RELEASE`, extracted
   with `git archive`), stops it mid-arc and finishes it on HEAD.
3. `node evals/probe.ts`: the targeted probe against the real, authenticated CLIs.
4. The paid fixture, `evals/m1/`: once per merged batch, never per worktree agent.

## The targeted probe

```sh
node evals/probe.ts
```

Runs the production argv builder, runner and adapter against the real `claude` and `codex` (both must be on
PATH and logged in): the backend smoke, Codex fresh and resume, a real shell lane, the Claude judgment and
implementer argvs, and the Fable id pin. Prints `PASS|FAIL <check> <detail>` per check and `USAGE` lines, keeps
its run dir for inspection, and exits non-zero on any FAIL. Cost: pennies.

## The M1 fixture

Two serial units against a small real Node repo, through the real `roadmap start`, graded on the plan's loose
criteria. Run it under both profiles, each in a fresh directory:

```sh
node evals/m1/setup.ts /var/tmp/m1-default
node evals/m1/driver.ts /var/tmp/m1-default --profile default
node evals/m1/check.ts /var/tmp/m1-default

node evals/m1/setup.ts /var/tmp/m1-claude-only
node evals/m1/driver.ts /var/tmp/m1-claude-only --profile claude-only
node evals/m1/check.ts /var/tmp/m1-claude-only
```

- `setup.ts <dir>` lays out the fixture: `repo/` (branches `main` and `integration`, in-tree `.roadmap/` with one
  contract, the C-nn ledger, invariants and an empty-routing config) and `input/` (plan.json, one spec per unit,
  rulings.md). Unit `slug` adds `slugify`; unit `page-id` builds on it, so it can only merge after `slug` and from
  the advanced integration tip, and its clause B2 is one a careless implementation misses. The arc is
  `m1-fixture-<12 hex of sha256(dir)>`: unique per fixture dir, so fake runs going in parallel (each with its
  own host dir) never share invocation ids, which key workload membership host-wide.
- `driver.ts <dir> --profile default|claude-only` runs `bin/roadmap start`, which returns once the detached
  supervisor reports ready (`{kind: ready, generation, supervisor}`) while the run goes on in the background.
  The driver then polls `roadmap status` (every 10 s, 90 minute hard timeout) until the supervisor process has
  exited and `run.state` is `complete`, `refused` or `no-owner`, and writes `<dir>/report.json` with how the
  run ended (`endedBy`), the generation it ended on and the final executor's exit line. It uses the machine's
  host lock, so no other arc may run on the host meanwhile. `claude-only` takes `codex` off PATH. If the run
  parks on a blocking needs-user, the driver sends `stop` (nobody is there to answer), waits for the supervisor
  to exit, and check grades the needs-user for coherence. On the timeout it sends `stop`, waits 5 minutes, then
  SIGKILLs the supervisor and the executor.
- `check.ts <dir>` prints one JSON line with every criterion, then the two lists, and exits non-zero on any
  failed criterion: both units merged or parked with a coherent needs-user; the integration head is the tested
  candidate; `git diff main...integration` is product-only; `refs/roadmap/<arc>` verifies against its manifest
  and covers the last publication; every judgment session is fresh; one usage fact per backend call; no model
  id outside `launch.json` and captured backend output.

Cost: whatever two small real units cost per profile, with plan-check, build and gate calls for each, plus
the backend smoke; expected under a few dollars for both profiles together. Run it once per merged batch.

`--fake <scenario.json>` runs the same driver against the fake backends behind PATH shims, with a host dir
inside the fixture, for free (5 minute timeout). `evals/m1/scenarios/clean.json` merges both units first time;
`bumpy.json` adds a redirect, a red lane and its fix round, and a gate revise. This is how `npm test`
validates the fixture; it says nothing about the real models.

### Reading the report's two lists

- `NOT EXERCISED: …` names the pipeline branches this run's journal shows no trace of, from: redirect, red
  lane, fix round, conflict/merge-in, red candidate, base-red, gate revise, unpublished/fresh candidate,
  usage-limit. Real models on a small fixture usually take the straight path, so a long list is expected, not
  a failure: those branches are covered by the fake-backed deterministic fixtures in `npm test`, and this run
  is evidence only for the branches it did take.
- `CANNOT SHOW: …` is fixed: issue mode, real cgroup containment, crash boundaries under real models, and
  week-long reliability. No run of this fixture is evidence for any of them.
